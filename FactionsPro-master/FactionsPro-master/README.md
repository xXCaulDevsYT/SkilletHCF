With the upcoming update, I've decided to move away from github to a private repo. This means FactionsPro will no longer be open-sourced. However, this doesn't mean that FactionsPro is gone, it just means that I'll be self-hosting it. Read the note in the plugin description on the Pocketmine forums for more information regarding how to submit bugs and feature requests. Also, I'm availible @Tethered_ on twitter if you have any questions.
